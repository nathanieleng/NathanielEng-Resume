        My name is Nathaniel Eng and I am currently a college student at the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in business looking to pursue a concentration in information systems. Since I reside in the bay area, I am extremely driven to pursue a job in the Silicon Valley in order to impactfully contribute to the future of the business world and learn about all the innovation that is going on there. I was inspired to pursue the major that I am working towards by my father. He studied something similar to what I am pursuing in college, and his current occupation in the corporate world is something that I would like to make a reality in the future for me. 

In terms of professional experience, I have not gained a significant amount of it to this date. So far, I have been a part of a few volunteering opportunities where I have helped in the marketing platforms for a few startup technology companies in my area. I did these through an organization called the California Scholastic Federation, or CSF for short. Other than the various volunteering experiences, my professional experience includes retail work as I currently hold a part-time job at Abercrombie and Fitch, and accounting work for a Tennis Academy. While each of these experiences may seem to be drastically different, I believe that each opportunity I have engaged in has helped me to view different aspects of business and to fully understand what each element is truly about. 

Due to the various types of professional experience that I have so far, I have a decent understanding of what different aspects of the business world are made up of, and what knowledge and education is needed in order to excel at each individual concentration. I have also become aware of which aspects of business I enjoy, and which concentrations that I am not so fond of. Having prior knowledge and experience before entering the business field is very important, and I believe that I have just that.  

Based on the work experience I have so far, I have gotten limited insight into various concentrations in the business world, ranging from finance and accounting to a bit of marketing. Therefore, I have minor experience in all of these specific fields which makes me a more knowledgeable and overall well-rounded candidate that can have expertise in more than just one particular operation in a business. As I continue to pursue my college degree, I hope to gain more professional experience through the courses I take, partaking in research, and internships that will help me gain a better sense of what I want to really do with the degree I earn in college.  

Overall, I still seek to gain more professional experience in the field that I am interested in focusing on for business, as this will make me understand the nuances of business operations that are currently unfamiliar to me. I have learned valuable skills from the experiences that I have gained thus far, which have helped me to become a more focused and knowledgeable contributor to any company.
